This website is my personal corner of the internet where I share thoughts on digital health, medical informatics, and AI in healthcare.

## Design

The design aims for clarity and readability. Light and dark themes are based on [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), a color scheme by Steph Ango that prioritizes comfort for extended reading.

## Typography

- **Body text:** [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) by Vercel
- **Navbar, footer, and code:** [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font)

## What is Clinical Informatics?

Clinical informatics sits at the intersection of healthcare, information science, and computer science. It focuses on optimizing the use of information to improve patient care.

### Electronic Health Records

EHRs are the backbone of modern healthcare IT. Understanding their structure, limitations, and potential is essential for anyone working in healthcare.

### Clinical Decision Support

CDS systems help clinicians make better decisions by presenting relevant information at the point of care. From drug interaction alerts to diagnostic suggestions, these tools can significantly impact patient outcomes.

### Data Quality

The principle of "garbage in, garbage out" applies strongly here. Ensuring data quality at the point of entry is crucial for any downstream analysis or AI application.

## The Human Factor

Technology is only as good as its implementation. User-centered design and change management are critical success factors.

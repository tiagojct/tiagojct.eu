## The Shifting Landscape

Digital health continues to evolve rapidly. Here are some key trends I've been observing:

### Remote Patient Monitoring

The adoption of remote monitoring devices has accelerated. Patients now have access to continuous glucose monitors, smart blood pressure cuffs, and wearable ECG devices that transmit data directly to their healthcare providers.

### AI-Assisted Diagnostics

Machine learning models are increasingly being integrated into clinical workflows. From radiology to pathology, AI is augmenting human expertise rather than replacing it.

### Interoperability Standards

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) adoption continues to grow, making it easier to exchange health data between systems.

## Looking Ahead

The convergence of these trends suggests a future where healthcare is more proactive, personalized, and patient-centered.

## A New Era of Learning

The integration of AI into medical education presents both opportunities and challenges.

### Personalized Learning Paths

AI can analyze student performance and adapt curriculum delivery. Students struggling with certain concepts receive additional resources, while those excelling can move ahead.

### Virtual Patients

Simulated patient encounters powered by large language models allow students to practice clinical reasoning in a safe environment. These systems can present rare conditions that students might not encounter during clinical rotations.

### Assessment and Feedback

Automated assessment tools can evaluate clinical notes, diagnostic reasoning, and even communication skills, providing immediate feedback to learners.

## Ethical Considerations

As we integrate these tools, we must ensure students develop critical thinking skills and don't become overly reliant on AI assistance.

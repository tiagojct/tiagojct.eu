Good documentation is often overlooked, but it's one of the most valuable things you can create. Whether it's for code, projects, or processes, documentation pays dividends.

## Why Documentation Matters

- **Onboarding**: New team members can get up to speed faster
- **Knowledge sharing**: Prevent knowledge silos
- **Future you**: You'll thank yourself later when you need to remember how something works
- **Professional**: Shows that you care about quality

## Types of Documentation

1. **README files**: The first thing people see
2. **API docs**: How to use your code
3. **Architecture docs**: How your system works
4. **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides
5. **FAQs**: Common questions and answers

## Best Practices

- Keep it up-to-date
- Make it searchable
- Include examples
